So my game takes place in a snowy cold place, sometime in winter. The player is a little gingerbread man who is trying to traverse the icey terrain to find his way back home to his gingerbread house. You as the player will have to complete two different levels of parkour to reach the gingerbread house. The first level is very easy as you will only have to make a few jumps from platform to platform. But after you complete the first level you will have to do the much harder second level. The second level consists of similar jumps, but there are also walls that block your way from completeing these jumps. You will have to use ur gaming skills to perfectly time the jumps in order to be able to make it to the next platform without falling.
